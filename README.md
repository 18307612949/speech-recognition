Simple speech recognition working with MFCC
===========================================

The program contains per se no database. Users create their personal word list by dictating words using a microphone. All words from this word list can later be recognised by the program.

The program is licensed under the GPL version 3 or (at your opinion) any later version, see the file COPYING for details.

To build simply run make. The [ALSA](http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page) development files are required.
